  abstract  = "Being able to digest milk sugar beyond the age of weaning is a
               rather new trait in humans. The calculated age of the
               responsible mutations largely coincides with the introduction of
               dairy farming. Recent European populations exhibit a gradient of
               high levels of lactose tolerance in the north and lower numbers
               in the south. Lactase persistence is believed to have co-evolved
               with farming or livestock keeping as a selective advantage.
               Palaeogenetic data of prehistoric individuals, however, have so
               far not provided any clear evidence that the spread of the
               lactase persistence mutation predates the Roman period, while
               persistence increases throughout the Middle Ages. In contrast,
               evidence of dairy processing reaches back to the introduction of
               farming in the Neolithic. In this paper, we investigate lactase
               persistence in the La Tène period of the European Iron Age. 39
               individuals from Austria, France, Hungary and Switzerland have
               been successfully genotyped for the two single nucleotide
               polymorphisms (SNPs) 13910C/T and 22018G/A, which are associated
               with lactose tolerance. None of those individuals carries the
               homozygous variant of either of the two SNPs, while four
               individuals are heterozygous at 22018G/A. This implies that
               during the Iron Age processed dairy products like cheese and
               yoghurt still represented the common supply of milk-derived
               nutrients while fresh milk played only a minor role in the
               regions studied here. The population-wide spread of the lactose
               tolerance trait in Europe therefore clearly post-dates the Iron
               Age.",

              the sources of the majority of previously published ancient
              African genomes. However, the high temperature environments that
              characterise much of Africa often lead to poor preservation of
              skeletal remains. Here, we successfully reconstruct and analyse
              genome-wide data from the naturally mummified hair of a
              4000-year-old individual from Sudan in northeastern Africa, after
              failed attempts at DNA extraction from teeth, petrous, and
              cranium of this and other individuals from the Kadruka
              cemeteries. We find that hair DNA extracted with an established
              single-stranded library protocol is unusually enriched in
              ultra-short DNA molecules and exhibits substantial interior
              molecular damage. The aDNA was nonetheless amenable to genetic

              with established models for the southward dispersal of Middle

              Africa, and provide a possible genetic source population for this

              allows for large-scale meta-analysis applications.
              Trans-generational past human mobility is one of the key aspects
              that ancient genomics can contribute to since changes in genetic
              ancestry-unlike cultural changes seen in the archaeological
              record-necessarily reflect movements of people. Here, we present
              an algorithm for spatiotemporal mapping of genetic profiles,
              which allow for direct estimates of past human mobility from
              large ancient genomic datasets. The key idea of the method is to
              derive a spatial probability surface of genetic similarity for
              each individual in its respective past. This is achieved by first
              creating an interpolated ancestry field through space and time
              based on multivariate statistics and Gaussian process regression
              and then using this field to map the ancient individuals into
              space according to their genetic profile. We apply this algorithm
              to a dataset of 3138 aDNA samples with genome-wide data from
              Western Eurasia in the last 10,000 y. Finally, we condense this
              sample-wise record with a simple summary statistic into a
              diachronic measure of mobility for subregions in Western,
              Central, and Southern Europe. For regions and periods with
              sufficient data coverage, our similarity surfaces and mobility
              estimates show general concordance with previous results and
              provide a meta-perspective of genetic changes and human mobility.",

              Demographic models of current interest typically consist of a set
              of discrete populations, their sizes and growth rates, and
              continuous and pulse migrations between those populations over a
              number of epochs, which can require dozens of parameters to fully
              describe. There is currently no standard format to define such
              models, significantly hampering progress in the field. In
              particular, the important task of translating the model
              descriptions in published work into input suitable for population
              genetic simulators is labor intensive and error prone. We propose
              the Demes data model and file format, built on widely used
              technologies, to alleviate these issues. Demes provide a
              well-defined and unambiguous model of populations and their

              a text file format that is designed for simplicity and clarity.

  abstract  = "The history of the British Isles and Ireland is characterized by
               multiple periods of major cultural change, including the
               influential transformation after the end of Roman rule, which
               precipitated shifts in language, settlement patterns and
               material culture1. The extent to which migration from
               continental Europe mediated these transitions is a matter of
               long-standing debate2–4. Here we study genome-wide ancient DNA
               from 460 medieval northwestern Europeans—including 278
               individuals from England—alongside archaeological data, to infer
               contemporary population dynamics. We identify a substantial
               increase of continental northern European ancestry in early
               medieval England, which is closely related to the early medieval
               and present-day inhabitants of Germany and Denmark, implying
               large-scale substantial migration across the North Sea into
               Britain during the Early Middle Ages. As a result, the
               individuals who we analysed from eastern England derived up to
               76\% of their ancestry from the continental North Sea zone,
               albeit with substantial regional variation and heterogeneity
               within sites. We show that women with immigrant ancestry were
               more often furnished with grave goods than women with local
               ancestry, whereas men with weapons were as likely not to be of
               immigrant ancestry. A comparison with present-day Britain
               indicates that subsequent demographic events reduced the
               fraction of continental northern European ancestry while
               introducing further ancestry components into the English gene
               pool, including substantial southwestern European ancestry most
               closely related to that seen in Iron Age France5,6.
               Archaeogenetic study of ancient DNA from medieval northwestern
               Europeans reveals substantial increase of continental northern
               European ancestry in Britain, suggesting mass migration across

  abstract = "We are a group of archaeologists, anthropologists, curators and
              geneticists representing diverse global communities and 31
              countries. All of us met in a virtual workshop dedicated to
              ethics in ancient DNA research held in November 2020. There was
              widespread agreement that globally applicable ethical guidelines
              are needed, but that recent recommendations grounded in
              discussion about research on human remains from North America are
              not always generalizable worldwide. Here we propose the following
              globally applicable guidelines, taking into consideration diverse
              contexts. These hold that: (1) researchers must ensure that all
              regulations were followed in the places where they work and from
              which the human remains derived; (2) researchers must prepare a
              detailed plan prior to beginning any study; (3) researchers must
              minimize damage to human remains; (4) researchers must ensure
              that data are made available following publication to allow
              critical re-examination of scientific findings; and (5)
              researchers must engage with other stakeholders from the
              beginning of a study and ensure respect and sensitivity to
              stakeholder perspectives. We commit to adhering to these
              guidelines and expect they will promote a high ethical standard
              in DNA research on human remains going forward.",

               heart of ancient migration routes through Europe, yet our
               knowledge about social and genetic processes here remains
               sparse. To shed light on these questions, we report new
               whole-genome data for 28 individuals dated to between ~ 4700
               BCE–400 CE from two sites in present-day eastern Croatia. In the
               Middle Neolithic we evidence first cousin mating practices and
               strong genetic continuity from the Early Neolithic. In the
               Middle Bronze Age community that we studied, we find multiple
               closely related males suggesting a patrilocal social
               organisation. We also find in that community an unexpected
               genetic ancestry profile distinct from individuals found at
               contemporaneous sites in the region, due to the addition of
               hunter-gatherer-related ancestry. These findings support
               archaeological evidence for contacts with communities further
               north in the Carpathian Basin. Finally, an individual dated to
               Roman times exhibits an ancestry profile that is broadly present

  abstract = "The deep population history of East Asia remains poorly
              understood owing to a lack of ancient DNA data and sparse
              sampling of present-day people1,2. Here we report genome-wide
              data from 166 East Asian individuals dating to between 6000 BC
              and AD 1000 and 46 present-day groups. Hunter-gatherers from
              Japan, the Amur River Basin, and people of Neolithic and Iron Age
              Taiwan and the Tibetan Plateau are linked by a deeply splitting
              lineage that probably reflects a coastal migration during the
              Late Pleistocene epoch. We also follow expansions during the
              subsequent Holocene epoch from four regions. First,
              hunter-gatherers from Mongolia and the Amur River Basin have
              ancestry shared by individuals who speak Mongolic and Tungusic
              languages, but do not carry ancestry characteristic of farmers
              from the West Liao River region (around 3000 BC), which
              contradicts theories that the expansion of these farmers spread
              the Mongolic and Tungusic proto-languages. Second, farmers from
              the Yellow River Basin (around 3000 BC) probably spread
              Sino-Tibetan languages, as their ancestry dispersed both to
              Tibet-where it forms approximately 84\% of the gene pool in some
              groups-and to the Central Plain, where it has contributed around
              59-84\% to modern Han Chinese groups. Third, people from Taiwan
              from around 1300 BC to AD 800 derived approximately 75\% of their
              ancestry from a lineage that is widespread in modern individuals
              who speak Austronesian, Tai-Kadai and Austroasiatic languages,
              and that we hypothesize derives from farmers of the Yangtze River
              Valley. Ancient people from Taiwan also derived about 25\% of
              their ancestry from a northern lineage that is related to, but
              different from, farmers of the Yellow River Basin, which suggests
              an additional north-to-south expansion. Fourth, ancestry from

              Sicilians that covers the Early Mesolithic to Early Neolithic
              period. We find that the Early Mesolithic hunter-gatherers (HGs)
              are a highly drifted sister lineage to Early Holocene western
              European HGs, whereas a quarter of the Late Mesolithic HGs
              ancestry is related to HGs from eastern Europe and the Near East.
              This indicates substantial gene flow from (south-)eastern Europe
              between the Early and Late Mesolithic. The Early Neolithic
              farmers are genetically most similar to those from the Balkan and
              Greece, and carry only a maximum of ∼7\% ancestry from Sicilian
              Mesolithic HGs. Ancestry changes match changes in dietary profile
              and material culture, except for two individuals who may provide
              tentative initial evidence that HGs adopted elements of farming
              in Sicily.One-sentence summary Genome-wide and isotopic data from
              prehistoric Sicilians reveal a pre-farming connection to (south-)

              shaped by a complex pattern of population separations followed by
              isolation and subsequent admixture. This pattern, reaching at
              least as far back as the appearance of our species in the
              paleontological record, has left its traces in our genomes.
              Reconstructing a population's history from these traces is a
              challenging problem. Here we present a novel approach based on
              the Multiple Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (MSMC) to analyze
              the separation history between populations. Our approach, called
              MSMC-IM, uses an improved implementation of the MSMC (MSMC2) to
              estimate coalescence rates within and across pairs of
              populations, and then fits a continuous Isolation-Migration model
              to these rates to obtain a time-dependent estimate of gene flow.
              We show, using simulations, that our method can identify complex
              demographic scenarios involving post-split admixture or archaic
              introgression. We apply MSMC-IM to whole genome sequences from 15
              worldwide populations, tracking the process of human genetic
              diversification. We detect traces of extremely deep ancestry
              between some African populations, with around 1\% of ancestry
              dating to divergences older than a million years ago.",

  abstract = "The Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe represents an
              important test case for the study of human population movements
              during prehistoric periods. During the Last Glacial Maximum
              (LGM), the peninsula formed a periglacial refugium [1] for
              hunter-gatherers (HGs) and thus served as a potential source for
              the re-peopling of northern latitudes [2]. The post-LGM genetic
              signature was previously described as a cline from Western HG
              (WHG) to Eastern HG (EHG), further shaped by later Holocene
              expansions from the Near East and the North Pontic steppes [3-9].
              Western and central Europe were dominated by ancestry associated
              with the ∼14,000-year-old individual from Villabruna, Italy,
              which had largely replaced earlier genetic ancestry, represented
              by 19,000-15,000-year-old individuals associated with the
              Magdalenian culture [2]. However, little is known about the
              genetic diversity in southern European refugia, the presence of
              distinct genetic clusters, and correspondence with geography.
              Here, we report new genome-wide data from 11 HGs and Neolithic
              individuals that highlight the late survival of Paleolithic
              ancestry in Iberia, reported previously in Magdalenian-associated
              individuals. We show that all Iberian HGs, including the oldest,
              a ∼19,000-year-old individual from El Mirón in Spain, carry dual
              ancestry from both Villabruna and the Magdalenian-related
              individuals. Thus, our results suggest an early connection
              between two potential refugia, resulting in a genetic ancestry
              that survived in later Iberian HGs. Our new genomic data from
              Iberian Early and Middle Neolithic individuals show that the dual
              Iberian HG genomic legacy pertains in the peninsula, suggesting
              that expanding farmers mixed with local HGs. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",

              genes, cultures and languages. In this study, we report novel
              genome-wide data for 763 individuals from Armenia, Georgia,
              Kazakhstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine and

              distinct admixture clines stretching between various western and
              eastern Eurasian ancestries, mirroring geography. The Botai and
              more recent ancient genomes from Siberia show a decrease in
              contributions from so-called 'ancient North Eurasian' ancestry
              over time, which is detectable only in the northern-most
              'forest-tundra' cline. The intermediate 'steppe-forest' cline
              descends from the Late Bronze Age steppe ancestries, while the
              'southern steppe' cline further to the south shows a strong
              West/South Asian influence. Ancient genomes suggest a northward
              spread of the southern steppe cline in Central Asia during the
              first millennium BC. Finally, the genetic structure of Caucasus
              populations highlights a role of the Caucasus Mountains as a
              barrier to gene flow and suggests a post-Neolithic gene flow into
              North Caucasus populations from the steppe.",

              individuals obtained from Egyptian mummies. The samples recovered
              from Middle Egypt span around 1,300 years of ancient Egyptian
              history from the New Kingdom to the Roman Period. Our analyses

               information and organismic functions, fitness, and evolution.
               Complex phenotypes, which are also called quantitative traits,
               often depend on multiple genomic loci. Their evolution builds on
               genome evolution in a complicated way, which involves selection,
               genetic drift, mutations and recombination. Here we develop a
               coarse-grained evolutionary statistics for phenotypes, which
               decouples from details of the underlying genotypes. We derive
               approximate evolution equations for the distribution of
               phenotype values within and across populations. This dynamics
               covers evolutionary processes at high and low recombination
               rates, that is, it applies to sexual and asexual populations. In
               a fitness landscape with a single optimal phenotype value, the
               phenotypic diversity within populations and the divergence
               between populations reach evolutionary equilibria, which
               describe stabilizing selection. We compute the equilibrium
               distributions of both quantities analytically and we show that
               the ratio of mean divergence and diversity depends on the
               strength of selection in a universal way: it is largely
               independent of the phenotype's genomic encoding and of the
               recombination rate. This establishes a new method for the
               inference of selection on molecular phenotypes beyond the genome

               Athabascans and Amerindians, entered the Americas as a single

  abstract  = "Modern humans arrived in Europe ~45,000 years ago, but little is
               known about their genetic composition before the start of
               farming ~8,500 years ago. Here we analyse genome-wide data from
               51 Eurasians from ~45,000-7,000 years ago. Over this time, the
               proportion of Neanderthal DNA decreased from 3-6\% to around
               2\%, consistent with natural selection against Neanderthal
               variants in modern humans. Whereas there is no evidence of the
               earliest modern humans in Europe contributing to the genetic
               composition of present-day Europeans, all individuals between
               ~37,000 and ~14,000 years ago descended from a single founder
               population which forms part of the ancestry of present-day
               Europeans. An ~35,000-year-old individual from northwest Europe
               represents an early branch of this founder population which was
               then displaced across a broad region, before reappearing in
               southwest Europe at the height of the last Ice Age ~19,000 years
               ago. During the major warming period after ~14,000 years ago, a
               genetic component related to present-day Near Easterners became
               widespread in Europe. These results document how population

               the genetic composition of the current British population. Here,
               we present whole-genome sequences from 10 individuals excavated
               close to Cambridge in the East of England, ranging from the late
               Iron Age to the middle Anglo-Saxon period. By analysing shared
               rare variants with hundreds of modern samples from Britain and
               Europe, we estimate that on average the contemporary East
               English population derives 38\% of its ancestry from Anglo-Saxon
               migrations. We gain further insight with a new method, rarecoal,
               which infers population history and identifies fine-scale
               genetic ancestry from rare variants. Using rarecoal we find that
               the Anglo-Saxon samples are closely related to modern Dutch and
               Danish populations, while the Iron Age samples share ancestors
               with multiple Northern European populations including Britain.",

  abstract = "When selection is acting on a large, genetically diverse
              population, beneficial alleles increase in frequency. This fact
              can be used to map quantitative trait loci by sequencing the
              pooled DNA from the population at consecutive time points, and
              observing allele frequency changes. Here we present a population
              genetic method to analyse time-series data of allele frequencies
              from such an experiment. Beginning with a range of proposed
              evolutionary scenarios, the method measures the consistency of
              each with the observed frequency changes. Evolutionary theory is
              utilized to formulate equations of motion for the allele
              frequencies, following which likelihoods for having observed the
              sequencing data under each scenario are derived. Comparison of
              these likelihoods gives an insight into the prevailing dynamics
              of the system under study. We illustrate the method by
              quantifying selective effects from an experiment in which two
              phenotypically different yeast strains were first crossed and
              then propagated under heat stress (Parts et al., Genome Res.
              2011). From these data we discover that about 6\% of polymorphic
              sites evolve non-neutrally under heat stress condition, either
              because of their linkage to beneficial (driver) alleles or
              because they are drivers themselves. We further identify 44
              genomic regions containing one or more candidate driver alleles,
              quantify their apparent selective advantage, obtain estimates of
              recombination rates within the regions, and show that the
              dynamics of the drivers display a strong signature of selection
              going beyond additive models. Our approach is applicable to study
              adaptation in a range of systems under different evolutionary
              pressures.",

  abstract = "In non-recombining genomes, genetic linkage can be an important
              evolutionary force. Linkage generates interference interactions,
              by which simultaneously occurring mutations affect each other's
              chance of fixation. Here, we develop a comprehensive model of
              adaptive evolution in linked genomes, which integrates
              interference interactions between multiple beneficial and
              deleterious mutations into a unified framework. By an approximate
              analytical solution, we predict the fixation rates of these
              mutations, as well as the probabilities of beneficial and
              deleterious alleles at fixed genomic sites. We find that
              interference interactions generate a regime of emergent
              neutrality: all genomic sites with selection coefficients smaller
              in magnitude than a characteristic threshold have nearly random
              fixed alleles, and both beneficial and deleterious mutations at
              these sites have nearly neutral fixation rates. We show that this
              dynamics limits not only the speed of adaptation, but also a
              population's degree of adaptation in its current environment. We
              apply the model to different scenarios: stationary adaptation in
              a time-dependent environment, and approach to equilibrium in a
              fixed environment. In both cases, the analytical predictions are
              in good agreement with numerical simulations. Our results suggest
              that interference can severely compromise biological functions in
              an adapting population, which sets viability limits on adaptive
              evolution under linkage.",
