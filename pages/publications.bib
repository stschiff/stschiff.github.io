               domestication, and development of metallurgy. This study focuses
               on two north Eurasian sites sharing Siberian genetic ancestry.
               One of the sites, Rostovka, is associated with the Seima-Turbino
               (ST) phenomenon (~2200-1900 BCE) that is characterized by
               elaborate metallurgical objects found throughout Northern
               Eurasia. The genetic profiles of Rostovka individuals vary widely
               along the forest-tundra Siberian genetic cline represented by
               many modern Uralic-speaking populations, and the genetic
               heterogeneity observed is consistent with the current
               understanding of the ST being a transcultural phenomenon.
               Individuals from the second site, Bolshoy Oleni Ostrov in Kola,
               in comparison form a tighter cluster on the Siberian ancestry
               cline. We further explore this Siberian ancestry profile and
               assess the role of the ST phenomenon and other contemporaneous BA
               cultures in the spread of Uralic languages and Siberian ancestry.",

               hominins and harbours the largest human genetic diversity in the
               world. Yet, despite its relevance for human origins and spread
               around the globe, the formation and processes of its gene pool in
               the past are still largely unknown. Here, we present a time
               transect of genome-wide sequences from nine individuals recovered
               from a single site in South Africa, Oakhurst Rockshelter.
               Spanning the whole Holocene, the ancient DNA of these individuals
               allows us to reconstruct the demographic trajectories of the
               indigenous San population and their ancestors during the last
               10,000 years. We show that, in contrast to most regions around
               the world, the population history of southernmost Africa was not
               characterized by several waves of migration, replacement and
               admixture but by long-lasting genetic continuity from the early
               Holocene to the end of the Later Stone Age. Although the advent
               of pastoralism and farming substantially transformed the gene
               pool in most parts of southern Africa after 1,300 bp, we
               demonstrate using allele-frequency and identity-by-descent
               segment-based methods that the \textdaggerdbl{}Khomani San and
               Karretjiemense from South Africa still show direct signs of
               relatedness to the Oakhurst hunter-gatherers, a pattern obscured
               by recent, extensive non-Southern African admixture. Yet, some
               southern San in South Africa still preserve this ancient,
               Pleistocene-derived genetic signature, extending the period of
               genetic continuity until today.",

  abstract = "Malaria-causing protozoa of the genus Plasmodium have exerted one

              resistance alleles provide biomolecular footprints that outline
              the historical reach of these species1. Nevertheless, debate
              persists over when and how malaria parasites emerged as human
              pathogens and spread around the globe1,2. To address these
              questions, we generated high-coverage ancient mitochondrial and
              nuclear genome-wide data from P. falciparum, P. vivax and P.
              malariae from 16 countries spanning around 5,500 years of human
              history. We identified P. vivax and P. falciparum across
              geographically disparate regions of Eurasia from as early as the
              fourth and first millennia BCE, respectively; for P. vivax, this
              evidence pre-dates textual references by several millennia3.
              Genomic analysis supports distinct disease histories for P.
              falciparum and P. vivax in the Americas: similarities between
              now-eliminated European and peri-contact South American strains
              indicate that European colonizers were the source of American P.
              vivax, whereas the trans-Atlantic slave trade probably introduced
              P. falciparum into the Americas. Our data underscore the role of
              cross-cultural contacts in the dissemination of malaria, laying
              the biomolecular foundation for future palaeo-epidemiological
              research into the impact of Plasmodium parasites on human
              history. Finally, our unexpected discovery of P. falciparum in
              the high-altitude Himalayas provides a rare case study in which
              individual mobility can be inferred from infection status, adding
              to our knowledge of cross-cultural connectivity in the region

               featuring the earliest evidence for supra-regional organization
               north of the Alps. Often referred to as `early Celtic',
               suggesting tentative connections to later cultural phenomena,
               its societal and population structure remain enigmatic. Here we
               present genomic and isotope data from 31 individuals from this
               context in southern Germany, dating between 616 and 200 BCE. We
               identify multiple biologically related groups spanning three
               elite burials as far as 100 km apart, supported by
               trans-regional individual mobility inferred from isotope data.
               These include a close biological relationship between two of the
               richest burial mounds of the Hallstatt culture. Bayesian
               modelling points to an avuncular relationship between the two

               throughout Central-Eastern Europe, undergoing a decline after
               the late Iron Age (450 BCE to ~50 CE). Gretzinger et al. examine
               genetic evidence from 31 Iron Age individuals in southern
               Germany and find that this early Celtic society probably had a

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Fat deposition is modulated by environmental factors
              and genetic predisposition. Genome-wide association studies
              identified PNPLA3 p.I148M (rs738409) as a common variant that
              increases risk of developing liver steatosis. When and how this
              variant evolved in humans has not been studied to date. DESIGN:
              Here we analyse ancient DNA to track the history of this allele
              throughout human history. In total, 6444 published ancient
              (modern humans, Neanderthal, Denisovan) and 3943 published
              present day genomes were used for analysis after extracting
              genotype calls for PNPLA3 p.I148M. To quantify changes through
              time, logistic and, by grouping individuals according to
              geography and age, linear regression analyses were performed.
              RESULTS: We find that archaic human individuals (Neanderthal,
              Denisovan) exclusively carried a fixed PNPLA3 risk allele,
              whereas allele frequencies in modern human populations range from
              very low in Africa to >50\% in Mesoamerica. Over the last 15 000
              years, distributions of ancestral and derived alleles roughly
              match the present day distribution. Logistic regression analyses
              did not yield signals of natural selection during the last 10 000
              years. CONCLUSION: Archaic human individuals exclusively carried
              a fixed PNPLA3 allele associated with fatty liver, whereas allele
              frequencies in modern human populations are variable even in the
              oldest samples. Our observation might underscore the advantage of
              fat storage in cold climate and particularly for Neanderthal
              under ice age conditions. The absent signals of natural selection
              during modern human history does not support the thrifty gene
              hypothesis in case of PNPLA3 p.I148M.",

              populations we screen nearly 10,000 ancient human individuals for
              the presence of three copies of any of the target autosomes. We
              find clear genetic evidence for six cases of trisomy 21 (Down

              find overlapping skeletal markers, many of which are consistent
              with these syndromes. Interestingly, three cases of trisomy 21,
              and the case of trisomy 18 were detected in two contemporaneous
              sites in early Iron Age Spain (800-400 BCE), potentially

              molecular analyses (isotope analyses, ancient DNA) of the Iberian
              Final Bronze and Iron Age communities of Ibe- ria. Incidentally,
              a limited number of young children, often newborns, were exempt
              from the predominant cremation ritual, in favour of intramural
              inhumations inside buildings at certain settlements. The
              discourse surrounding the mean- ing and interpretation of this

              intramurally buried chil- dren found in three Early Iron Age
              settlements, dated between c. 800–450 BC. Population genetic

              San or Khoekhoe people, eight of them known-in-life, were removed
              from their graves on the farm Kruisrivier, near Sutherland in the
              Northern Cape Province of South Africa. They were donated to the
              Anatomy Department at the University of Cape Town. This was done
              without the knowledge or permission of their families. The donor
              was a medical student who removed the remains from the labourers'
              cemetery on his family farm. Nearly 100 years later, the remains
              are being returned to their community, accompanied by a range of
              community-driven interdisciplinary historical, archaeological and
              analytical (osteobiographic, craniofacial, ancient DNA, stable
              isotope) studies to document, as far as possible, their lives and

               responsible mutations largely coincides with the introduction of
               dairy farming. Recent European populations exhibit a gradient of
               high levels of lactose tolerance in the north and lower numbers
               in the south. Lactase persistence is believed to have co-evolved
               with farming or livestock keeping as a selective advantage.
               Palaeogenetic data of prehistoric individuals, however, have so
               far not provided any clear evidence that the spread of the
               lactase persistence mutation predates the Roman period, while
               persistence increases throughout the Middle Ages. In contrast,
               evidence of dairy processing reaches back to the introduction of
               farming in the Neolithic. In this paper, we investigate lactase
               persistence in the La Tène period of the European Iron Age. 39
               individuals from Austria, France, Hungary and Switzerland have
               been successfully genotyped for the two single nucleotide
               polymorphisms (SNPs) 13910C/T and 22018G/A, which are associated
               with lactose tolerance. None of those individuals carries the
               homozygous variant of either of the two SNPs, while four
               individuals are heterozygous at 22018G/A. This implies that
               during the Iron Age processed dairy products like cheese and
               yoghurt still represented the common supply of milk-derived
               nutrients while fresh milk played only a minor role in the
               regions studied here. The population-wide spread of the lactose
               tolerance trait in Europe therefore clearly post-dates the Iron
               Age.",

              Trans-generational past human mobility is one of the key aspects
              that ancient genomics can contribute to since changes in genetic
              ancestry-unlike cultural changes seen in the archaeological
              record-necessarily reflect movements of people. Here, we present
              an algorithm for spatiotemporal mapping of genetic profiles,
              which allow for direct estimates of past human mobility from
              large ancient genomic datasets. The key idea of the method is to
              derive a spatial probability surface of genetic similarity for
              each individual in its respective past. This is achieved by first
              creating an interpolated ancestry field through space and time
              based on multivariate statistics and Gaussian process regression
              and then using this field to map the ancient individuals into
              space according to their genetic profile. We apply this algorithm
              to a dataset of 3138 aDNA samples with genome-wide data from
              Western Eurasia in the last 10,000 y. Finally, we condense this
              sample-wise record with a simple summary statistic into a
              diachronic measure of mobility for subregions in Western,

              the 14th century, obtained following a salvage excavation at the

              individuals are genetically similar to modern AJ, but they show
              more variability in Eastern European-related ancestry than modern
              AJ. A third of the Erfurt individuals carried a mitochondrial

              levels of runs of homozygosity, suggest that the Erfurt community
              had already experienced the major reduction in size that affected
              modern AJ. The Erfurt bottleneck was more severe, implying
              substructure in medieval AJ. Overall, our results suggest that
              the AJ founder event and the acquisition of the main sources of
              ancestry pre-dated the 14th century and highlight late medieval
              genetic heterogeneity no longer present in modern AJ.",

              goal in population genetics, and with improving methods and data,
              ever more complex models are being proposed and tested.
              Demographic models of current interest typically consist of a set
              of discrete populations, their sizes and growth rates, and
              continuous and pulse migrations between those populations over a
              number of epochs, which can require dozens of parameters to fully
              describe. There is currently no standard format to define such
              models, significantly hampering progress in the field. In
              particular, the important task of translating the model
              descriptions in published work into input suitable for population
              genetic simulators is labor intensive and error prone. We propose
              the Demes data model and file format, built on widely used
              technologies, to alleviate these issues. Demes provide a
              well-defined and unambiguous model of populations and their
              properties that is straightforward to implement in software, and
              a text file format that is designed for simplicity and clarity.
              We provide thoroughly tested implementations of Demes parsers in
              multiple languages including Python and C, and showcase initial
              support in several simulators and inference methods. An
              introduction to the file format and a detailed specification are

  abstract  = "The history of the British Isles and Ireland is characterized by
               multiple periods of major cultural change, including the
               influential transformation after the end of Roman rule, which
               precipitated shifts in language, settlement patterns and
               material culture1. The extent to which migration from
               continental Europe mediated these transitions is a matter of
               long-standing debate2–4. Here we study genome-wide ancient DNA
               from 460 medieval northwestern Europeans—including 278
               individuals from England—alongside archaeological data, to infer
               contemporary population dynamics. We identify a substantial
               increase of continental northern European ancestry in early
               medieval England, which is closely related to the early medieval
               and present-day inhabitants of Germany and Denmark, implying
               large-scale substantial migration across the North Sea into
               Britain during the Early Middle Ages. As a result, the
               individuals who we analysed from eastern England derived up to
               76\% of their ancestry from the continental North Sea zone,
               albeit with substantial regional variation and heterogeneity
               within sites. We show that women with immigrant ancestry were
               more often furnished with grave goods than women with local
               ancestry, whereas men with weapons were as likely not to be of
               immigrant ancestry. A comparison with present-day Britain
               indicates that subsequent demographic events reduced the
               fraction of continental northern European ancestry while
               introducing further ancestry components into the English gene
               pool, including substantial southwestern European ancestry most
               closely related to that seen in Iron Age France5,6.
               Archaeogenetic study of ancient DNA from medieval northwestern
               Europeans reveals substantial increase of continental northern
               European ancestry in Britain, suggesting mass migration across
               the North Sea during the Early Middle Ages.",

              ethics in ancient DNA research held in November 2020. There was
              widespread agreement that globally applicable ethical guidelines

              discussion about research on human remains from North America are

              globally applicable guidelines, taking into consideration diverse
              contexts. These hold that: (1) researchers must ensure that all
              regulations were followed in the places where they work and from
              which the human remains derived; (2) researchers must prepare a
              detailed plan prior to beginning any study; (3) researchers must
              minimize damage to human remains; (4) researchers must ensure
              that data are made available following publication to allow
              critical re-examination of scientific findings; and (5)
              researchers must engage with other stakeholders from the
              beginning of a study and ensure respect and sensitivity to
              stakeholder perspectives. We commit to adhering to these

               BCE–400 CE from two sites in present-day eastern Croatia. In the

  abstract = "The deep population history of East Asia remains poorly
              understood owing to a lack of ancient DNA data and sparse
              sampling of present-day people1,2. Here we report genome-wide
              data from 166 East Asian individuals dating to between 6000 BC
              and AD 1000 and 46 present-day groups. Hunter-gatherers from
              Japan, the Amur River Basin, and people of Neolithic and Iron Age
              Taiwan and the Tibetan Plateau are linked by a deeply splitting
              lineage that probably reflects a coastal migration during the
              Late Pleistocene epoch. We also follow expansions during the
              subsequent Holocene epoch from four regions. First,
              hunter-gatherers from Mongolia and the Amur River Basin have
              ancestry shared by individuals who speak Mongolic and Tungusic
              languages, but do not carry ancestry characteristic of farmers
              from the West Liao River region (around 3000 BC), which
              contradicts theories that the expansion of these farmers spread
              the Mongolic and Tungusic proto-languages. Second, farmers from
              the Yellow River Basin (around 3000 BC) probably spread
              Sino-Tibetan languages, as their ancestry dispersed both to
              Tibet-where it forms approximately 84\% of the gene pool in some
              groups-and to the Central Plain, where it has contributed around
              59-84\% to modern Han Chinese groups. Third, people from Taiwan
              from around 1300 BC to AD 800 derived approximately 75\% of their
              ancestry from a lineage that is widespread in modern individuals
              who speak Austronesian, Tai-Kadai and Austroasiatic languages,
              and that we hypothesize derives from farmers of the Yangtze River
              Valley. Ancient people from Taiwan also derived about 25\% of
              their ancestry from a northern lineage that is related to, but
              different from, farmers of the Yellow River Basin, which suggests
              an additional north-to-south expansion. Fourth, ancestry from
              Yamnaya Steppe pastoralists arrived in western Mongolia after
              around 3000 BC but was displaced by previously established
              lineages even while it persisted in western China, as would be
              expected if this ancestry was associated with the spread of
              proto-Tocharian Indo-European languages. Two later gene flows
              affected western Mongolia: migrants after around 2000 BC with
              Yamnaya and European farmer ancestry, and episodic influences of
              later groups with ancestry from Turan.",

               individuals, including the first reported ancient DNA from the
               DRC, Uganda, and Botswana. These data demonstrate the

              agricultural transition in the Mediterranean due to its central
              position. We present a genomic transect for 19 prehistoric
              Sicilians that covers the Early Mesolithic to Early Neolithic
              period. We find that the Early Mesolithic hunter-gatherers (HGs)
              are a highly drifted sister lineage to Early Holocene western
              European HGs, whereas a quarter of the Late Mesolithic HGs
              ancestry is related to HGs from eastern Europe and the Near East.
              This indicates substantial gene flow from (south-)eastern Europe
              between the Early and Late Mesolithic. The Early Neolithic
              farmers are genetically most similar to those from the Balkan and
              Greece, and carry only a maximum of ∼7\% ancestry from Sicilian
              Mesolithic HGs. Ancestry changes match changes in dietary profile
              and material culture, except for two individuals who may provide
              tentative initial evidence that HGs adopted elements of farming
              in Sicily.One-sentence summary Genome-wide and isotopic data from
              prehistoric Sicilians reveal a pre-farming connection to (south-)
              eastern Europe, and tentative initial evidence that
              hunter-gatherers adopted some Neolithic aspects prior to

               lifestyle spread across Europe via separate continental and
               Mediterranean routes. Genomes from early European farmers have
               shown a clear Near Eastern/Anatolian genetic affinity with
               limited contribution from hunter-gatherers. However, no genomic
               data are available from modern-day France, where both routes
               converged, as evidenced by a mosaic cultural pattern. Here, we
               present genome-wide data from 101 individuals from 12 sites

               further understand the implications of these in Southern Central
               Europe, we analyze 96 ancient genomes from Switzerland, Southern

  abstract = "The genetic diversity of humans, like many species, has been
              shaped by a complex pattern of population separations followed by
              isolation and subsequent admixture. This pattern, reaching at
              least as far back as the appearance of our species in the
              paleontological record, has left its traces in our genomes.
              Reconstructing a population's history from these traces is a
              challenging problem. Here we present a novel approach based on
              the Multiple Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (MSMC) to analyze
              the separation history between populations. Our approach, called
              MSMC-IM, uses an improved implementation of the MSMC (MSMC2) to
              estimate coalescence rates within and across pairs of
              populations, and then fits a continuous Isolation-Migration model
              to these rates to obtain a time-dependent estimate of gene flow.
              We show, using simulations, that our method can identify complex
              demographic scenarios involving post-split admixture or archaic
              introgression. We apply MSMC-IM to whole genome sequences from 15
              worldwide populations, tracking the process of human genetic
              diversification. We detect traces of extremely deep ancestry
              between some African populations, with around 1\% of ancestry
              dating to divergences older than a million years ago.",

  abstract = "The Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe represents an
              important test case for the study of human population movements
              during prehistoric periods. During the Last Glacial Maximum
              (LGM), the peninsula formed a periglacial refugium [1] for
              hunter-gatherers (HGs) and thus served as a potential source for
              the re-peopling of northern latitudes [2]. The post-LGM genetic
              signature was previously described as a cline from Western HG
              (WHG) to Eastern HG (EHG), further shaped by later Holocene
              expansions from the Near East and the North Pontic steppes [3-9].
              Western and central Europe were dominated by ancestry associated
              with the ∼14,000-year-old individual from Villabruna, Italy,
              which had largely replaced earlier genetic ancestry, represented
              by 19,000-15,000-year-old individuals associated with the
              Magdalenian culture [2]. However, little is known about the
              genetic diversity in southern European refugia, the presence of
              distinct genetic clusters, and correspondence with geography.
              Here, we report new genome-wide data from 11 HGs and Neolithic
              individuals that highlight the late survival of Paleolithic
              ancestry in Iberia, reported previously in Magdalenian-associated
              individuals. We show that all Iberian HGs, including the oldest,
              a ∼19,000-year-old individual from El Mirón in Spain, carry dual
              ancestry from both Villabruna and the Magdalenian-related
              individuals. Thus, our results suggest an early connection
              between two potential refugia, resulting in a genetic ancestry
              that survived in later Iberian HGs. Our new genomic data from
              Iberian Early and Middle Neolithic individuals show that the dual
              Iberian HG genomic legacy pertains in the peninsula, suggesting
              that expanding farmers mixed with local HGs. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",

              genes, cultures and languages. In this study, we report novel
              genome-wide data for 763 individuals from Armenia, Georgia,
              Kazakhstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine and

              contributions from so-called 'ancient North Eurasian' ancestry
              over time, which is detectable only in the northern-most
              'forest-tundra' cline. The intermediate 'steppe-forest' cline
              descends from the Late Bronze Age steppe ancestries, while the
              'southern steppe' cline further to the south shows a strong
              West/South Asian influence. Ancient genomes suggest a northward
              spread of the southern steppe cline in Central Asia during the
              first millennium BC. Finally, the genetic structure of Caucasus
              populations highlights a role of the Caucasus Mountains as a
              barrier to gene flow and suggests a post-Neolithic gene flow into
              North Caucasus populations from the steppe.",

               often depend on multiple genomic loci. Their evolution builds on
               genome evolution in a complicated way, which involves selection,
               genetic drift, mutations and recombination. Here we develop a
               coarse-grained evolutionary statistics for phenotypes, which
               decouples from details of the underlying genotypes. We derive
               approximate evolution equations for the distribution of
               phenotype values within and across populations. This dynamics
               covers evolutionary processes at high and low recombination
               rates, that is, it applies to sexual and asexual populations. In
               a fitness landscape with a single optimal phenotype value, the
               phenotypic diversity within populations and the divergence
               between populations reach evolutionary equilibria, which
               describe stabilizing selection. We compute the equilibrium
               distributions of both quantities analytically and we show that
               the ratio of mean divergence and diversity depends on the
               strength of selection in a universal way: it is largely
               independent of the phenotype's genomic encoding and of the
               recombination rate. This establishes a new method for the
               inference of selection on molecular phenotypes beyond the genome
               level. We discuss the implications of our findings for the
               predictability of evolutionary processes.",

               Using ancient and modern genome-wide data, we found that the
               ancestors of all present-day Native Americans, including
               Athabascans and Amerindians, entered the Americas as a single
               migration wave from Siberia no earlier than 23 thousand years
               ago (ka) and after no more than an 8000-year isolation period in
               Beringia. After their arrival to the Americas, ancestral Native
               Americans diversified into two basal genetic branches around 13
               ka, one that is now dispersed across North and South America and
               the other restricted to North America. Subsequent gene flow
               resulted in some Native Americans sharing ancestry with
               present-day East Asians (including Siberians) and, more
               distantly, Australo-Melanesians. Putative ``Paleoamerican''

               Aboriginal Australians (speakers of Pama-Nyungan languages) and
               25 Papuans from the New Guinea Highlands. We find that Papuan
               and Aboriginal Australian ancestors diversified 25-40 thousand

               associated with limited gene flow from this region to the rest

               Distinguishing among these alternatives has been difficult. We
               generated 225 whole-genome sequences (225 at 8× depth, of which
               8 were increased to 30×; Illumina HiSeq 2000) from six modern
               Northeast African populations (100 Egyptians and five Ethiopian
               populations each represented by 25 individuals). West Eurasian
               components were masked out, and the remaining African haplotypes
               were compared with a panel of sub-Saharan African and

               composition of present-day Europeans, all individuals between
               ~37,000 and ~14,000 years ago descended from a single founder

  abstract  = "British population history has been shaped by a series of
               immigrations, including the early Anglo-Saxon migrations after
               400 CE. It remains an open question how these events affected
               the genetic composition of the current British population. Here,
               we present whole-genome sequences from 10 individuals excavated
               close to Cambridge in the East of England, ranging from the late
               Iron Age to the middle Anglo-Saxon period. By analysing shared
               rare variants with hundreds of modern samples from Britain and
               Europe, we estimate that on average the contemporary East
               English population derives 38\% of its ancestry from Anglo-Saxon
               migrations. We gain further insight with a new method, rarecoal,
               which infers population history and identifies fine-scale
               genetic ancestry from rare variants. Using rarecoal we find that
               the Anglo-Saxon samples are closely related to modern Dutch and
               Danish populations, while the Iron Age samples share ancestors
               with multiple Northern European populations including Britain.",

  abstract = "When selection is acting on a large, genetically diverse
              population, beneficial alleles increase in frequency. This fact
              can be used to map quantitative trait loci by sequencing the
              pooled DNA from the population at consecutive time points, and
              observing allele frequency changes. Here we present a population
              genetic method to analyse time-series data of allele frequencies
              from such an experiment. Beginning with a range of proposed
              evolutionary scenarios, the method measures the consistency of
              each with the observed frequency changes. Evolutionary theory is
              utilized to formulate equations of motion for the allele
              frequencies, following which likelihoods for having observed the
              sequencing data under each scenario are derived. Comparison of
              these likelihoods gives an insight into the prevailing dynamics
              of the system under study. We illustrate the method by
              quantifying selective effects from an experiment in which two
              phenotypically different yeast strains were first crossed and
              then propagated under heat stress (Parts et al., Genome Res.
              2011). From these data we discover that about 6\% of polymorphic
              sites evolve non-neutrally under heat stress condition, either
              because of their linkage to beneficial (driver) alleles or
              because they are drivers themselves. We further identify 44
              genomic regions containing one or more candidate driver alleles,
              quantify their apparent selective advantage, obtain estimates of
              recombination rates within the regions, and show that the
              dynamics of the drivers display a strong signature of selection
              going beyond additive models. Our approach is applicable to study
              adaptation in a range of systems under different evolutionary
              pressures.",

  abstract = "In non-recombining genomes, genetic linkage can be an important
              evolutionary force. Linkage generates interference interactions,
              by which simultaneously occurring mutations affect each other's
              chance of fixation. Here, we develop a comprehensive model of
              adaptive evolution in linked genomes, which integrates
              interference interactions between multiple beneficial and
              deleterious mutations into a unified framework. By an approximate
              analytical solution, we predict the fixation rates of these
              mutations, as well as the probabilities of beneficial and
              deleterious alleles at fixed genomic sites. We find that
              interference interactions generate a regime of emergent
              neutrality: all genomic sites with selection coefficients smaller
              in magnitude than a characteristic threshold have nearly random
              fixed alleles, and both beneficial and deleterious mutations at
              these sites have nearly neutral fixation rates. We show that this
              dynamics limits not only the speed of adaptation, but also a
              population's degree of adaptation in its current environment. We
              apply the model to different scenarios: stationary adaptation in
              a time-dependent environment, and approach to equilibrium in a
              fixed environment. In both cases, the analytical predictions are
              in good agreement with numerical simulations. Our results suggest
              that interference can severely compromise biological functions in
              an adapting population, which sets viability limits on adaptive
              evolution under linkage.",
